Version history (M/D/Y oldest to newest):
7/3/2017 1.0
 -First release

7/5/2017 2.0
 -Fix the bottom boundary issue that the player can pass under solid blocks with small mario
  riding yoshi.
 -Included sprite interaction boundary.

7/21/2017 2.1
 -Added a notice about placing ledges, and about custom blocks too.

12/29/2018 3.0
 -Updated to use LM v3.00's new dynamic level patch.

12/30/2018 3.0 (minor change)
 -Added a assert check to require a LM hijack at $05d9a1 in order to patch.

3/3/2020 3.1
 -Added an option to "soft-disable" the patch in-game based on RAM. This is by a request from
  DeGenerator: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=28538 he wanted some levels to behave
  normal while other levels have the hitboxes extended.
 -Added a new note on this Readme of newer potential bugs
5/30/2020 3.2
 -Freeram is now individual sides-based flags, meaning you can enable/disable top, bottom, left
  and right side individually.
 -Fixed a bug with [ConstrainMarioCollisionPoints] which loaded the freeram in 16-bit instead of 8.
 -Fixed a SA-1 issue at [Sprite_HorizLvl_blk_interYPos]
 -Slightly improved the insert size - $00E830 and $00E89C indexed now uses word-addressing because
  long jumps (JSL/JML) don't affect the data bank register.
7/28/2020 3.3 - Removal and then re-released with fixes
 -Was removed by MarioFanGamer: https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=102900 because the patch
  fails to check if sprites are outside the level, causing a game crash if Freeram use is on and
  certain bits are SET when the sprite is offlevel in a certain direction.
 -Overhaul the vertical level handling since it was awful.
 -The readme is now HTML and how object interaction being clamped works being explained using GIFs improved.
 -Several REP/SEP #$20 are removed because they are unnecessary as the freeram check just checks only specific
  bit(s).
9/24/2020 3.4 - Removal again.
 -This bug is fixed: If you are at least Super Mario and not crouching (any 2-block tall hitbox of the player),
  you'll interact the SECOND-bottommost row of blocks, meaning that if the user deliberately wanted no blocks on
  the last row for things like secret exits you have to fly under, well you cannot (if not crouching). It was
  revealed here:
   https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=102900&page=1&pid=1549174#p1549174
  As a side note, Mario's Y position ($96-$97) is UNAFFECTED by whether or not you are crouching or not, also if
  you are small mario or not. The only thing that is affected is if you are riding yoshi, your Y position is
  subtracted by $0010. However, obvious that your hitbox shrinks when you crouch.
 -JMLs back to SMW code now uses fastrom (sets the leftmost bit 23 of the 24-bit address).
