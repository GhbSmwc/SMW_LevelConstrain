In case if you are wondering why are there unused files here (such as individual frames in the subfolders, and [Developer_HitboxAssetForGIF.png]), they are intended for development purposes only (such as if you are updating the readme).
The boxes in the images are 1:1 ratio and accurately represents an example of the sprite size and the collision points used in the original SMW.

The GIFs are made using ScreenToGif, an open source tool on making GIFs.
